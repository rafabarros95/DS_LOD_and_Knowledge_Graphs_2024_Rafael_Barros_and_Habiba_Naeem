## This project from Naeem and me is basically following: 

 We're retrieving a dataset about 10.000 works through Open Alex's API based on sequencial calls. Larger dataset was not possible to apply this method due to API Restrictions. With the Dataset, we're using Google Colab for python code (Basically exploring the data, checking inconsistences and so on). After Data, we export the file into ".csv" so that we can use for building the Knowledge Graph in Neo4j and perhaps Gephi.
